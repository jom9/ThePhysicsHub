## Code of conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How you can contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Share the love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Think our_package is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.

### Ask a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Using The Physics Hub and have a problem? Browse the [website][website] to see if you can come up with a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. We'll try to do our best to come up with solutions to the problem.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the project maintainers by physhub@protonmail.com.

### Propose an idea üí°

Have an idea for a new simulation? Take a look at the [website][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. It helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using our simulations and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a simulation could use a better explanation? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

### Contribute code üìù

Care to fix bugs or implement new simulations for The Physics Hub? Awesome! üëè Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.

## Development guidelines

We try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.

1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.
3. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).
